# AirReq
AirReq is a desktop native application which capable of sending HTTP requests with features like authorization, headers, parameters, request bodies, and response analysis. It's a lightweight approach to create an API testing development tool that focuses solely on the core functionality of sending HTTP requests without containing the extensive feature set created for larger groups, as offered by Postman.

## About the project
I started this project to gain a deeper understanding of how Postman might be implemented and the underlying technologies involved. My focus was on implementing only the core features of Postman. I found the goal easily achievable, which allowed me to learn new hard skills. So I decided to only use technologies that I had never worked with before. Overall, the project for me is an environment to experiment with a new language, libraries, and frameworks.

## Used technologies
### Backend
* TypeScript
* Electron
### Frontend
* Angular (+ Angular CLI, Angular Material UI)
* Axios
